      <h1>Here's How Prisons Benefit from Inmate Labor </h1>

      While inmates earn as little as 16 cents an hour, Corecraft runs a $50 million-a-year industry. </div>

          <p class ="body">

Corecraft is “the ‘brand name’ for the Division of Correctional Industries.
</p>

<p class ="body">
Essentially, Corecraft markets prison labor. The Division of Industries was organized in 1893 pursuant to Section 184 of Correction Law, which authorized the Department to manufacture articles and goods utilizing inmate labor. It basically oversees the production of items made by inmates, from license plates to soap to socks.
</p>
<p class ="body">
Corcraft averages around $48 million in sales annually, according to the 2014 DOCCS report, a figure confirmed by an independent state comptroller report. Revenue from sales goes into the state general fund.
</p>
<p class ="body">
According to DOCCS’ spokesperson Patrick J. Bailey, the “average Corcraft inmate wage during FY15-16 was 65 cents an hour or about $1,092 per inmate per year.” The lowest Corcraft wage is 16 cents per hour, though some can earn bonuses equal to $1.14 per hour.

<h2> What Products Are Made Using Prison Labor </h2>

<p class ="body">

This chart shows what kind of products Corecraft makes based on their contracts with outside vendors for supplies and services.

The chemical category refers to cleaning supplies, literal chemicals for vehicle maintenance, and food service dish detergent. The supplies category refers to items like dustpans, waste baskets, clear containers for inmates to use in the shower, and more.

Under the service category, waste management services dominates. This is the category of spending where Corecraft hires outside help to make sure their production runs smoothly, from maintenance for their liscense plate machines to the delivery cost of all their actual supplies.

The signs category is the typical picture people see when they think of prison labor. Inmates make different kinds of liscense plates and highway signs. A lot of their products, in fact, are used in other correctional facilities, many of which are in New York.

<h3> Why Does This Matter?</h3>


<p class ="body">

State law requires local governments to purchase commodities from Corcraft if it has a product that satisfies the form, function and utility required. The law, in effect, gives Corcraft monopoly-like power over the state-wide municipal institution market because the law exempts Corcraft from another state law mandating competitive bidding.
