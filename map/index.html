		This map was created using 2010 Census Data and the Department of Education’s released math test scores for the 2019 year.

		It is important to note that these scores are hard to compare to previous years because of changes to the test format as well as common core standings. Generally, these scores show at first glance that the city is inching closer to 50% proficiency in reading and math.

		In New York City, 47.4% of students scored proficient in reading, compared with 46.7% last year while 45.6% passed math, compared with 42.7% last year. City students again significantly outperformed New York’s four other big districts of Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, and Yonkers.

		This is an improvement, but in no way does this predict a healthy future. Scores vary wildly at the school level, especially since many city schools are allowed to use past academic performance to screen students for admission. When looking at this map, parents and caretakers should also know that some selective campuses tend to post higher test scores.  Schools that don’t screen for past academic performance and serve larger shares of poor students, students with disabilities, or English learners tend to struggle on the test.

		<p class="bold">

		From last year’s score report, only 542 black 7th graders in all of NYC earned the top score of 4.

		14,566 black students took that test. Out of them, 2,003 black students earned a 3.

		This means that only 2,545 out of 14,566 black students in NYC are performing at level 3 or 4, which is grade level, and above grade level, respectively.
</p>
<p id="red">
		That means over 80% of black 7th graders in NYC failed to receive an adequate math education.

		This map focuses on people of Latin and Spanish descent in the Bronx. Keep in mind that a passing score is a 3 or 4. Click each pin to see how each school is performing. The color of the map, from light pink to dark burgundy, shows how many Latinx people call the Bronx their home.
