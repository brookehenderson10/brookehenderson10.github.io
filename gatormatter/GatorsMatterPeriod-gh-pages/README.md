Gators Matter Period is an initiative at the University of Florida to implement free menstrual care on campus. For my final project for Introduction to Web Apps taught by Professor McAdams, I created an information page for the initiative.

Here I will:

* Evaluate what you accomplished in the week.
* Explain why you did not complete what you said you would (if that is the case). refer to your approved proposal AND my comments on it.
* Describe any snags you hit.
