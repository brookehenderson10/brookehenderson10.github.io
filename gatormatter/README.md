# GatorsMatterPeriod
Gators Matter Period is an initiative at the University of Florida to implement free menstrual care on campus. For my final project for Introduction to Web Apps taught by Professor McAdams, I created an information page for the initiative.

Here I will:

* Evaluate what I accomplished in the week.
* Explain why I did not complete what I said I would (if that is the case).
* Describe any snags I hit.
* Say what I am pleased about.
* Include links to any libraries or tutorials I used.
* Explain my plans to overcome obstacles I encountered this week.


## Week 1
---

This week I created an interactive form and carousel. Because of bootstrap,  it wasn't too difficult to set up the carousel when I followed their examples. Fully understanding what each line of code took some time, especially "aria". For that I looked to codepen and found that aria can be used in a lot of different ways, especially with accessibility.

I ran into issues about image sizing for the carousel initially, and it took time to figure out how to make it move on click. I also got a little stuck when trying to position the text until I used the transform function along with the x and y axis. The form was more tricky, I was stuck here for a while especially getting it how I wanted to look. Until I figure it out, I have the American Woman project as a guide. I had to build on what I already knew about slidetoggle to make it animate the way I wanted to, and the tutorials helped with setting up the fact after each question. A lot of tutorials I saw set up the question and answer bank using variables in their javascript, but that was confusing to me.

I'm happy I had time to start on the CSS, but I'd like to make the form more visually appealing as well as improve the font. The forms submit button does not work, because I am still researching backend methods of catching the responses on an excel and then having them show on a chart on the page.

## Week 2

This week I added two maps, a share to twitter button and more CSS. One map, the main map, shows all of the universities and colleges within the U.S. that have free tampons and pads on campus. The second map can only be viewed after the University of Florida pin is clicked, and details locations specific to campus where menstrual care can be bought. Figuring out how to hide one map was difficult.

To create the maps, I reviewed the previous class map assignment. I ran into issues researching which locations within the U.S. offered free menstrual care on campus, as there was not always media coverage. To make sure I had comprehensive coverage, I spoke to representatives from FreeTheTampon.org.

I wanted to add a button that said, "go back to main map" after the Florida pin was clicked, but I will have to wait until next week to finish that. For now the map is easily set to zoom out so all pins can be found. Instead of using hide and show functions, I used center markers instead to create the appearance of two maps.
sxhe quiz with Javascript, but that was very difficult for me. Using JQuery streamlined the process. I had wanted to apply CSS to the map pop ups, but had ran out of time. As it is locations on the map are differentiated by their pin image.
