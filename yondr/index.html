	<p class ="redtext"> Bronx school for Law Government and Justice began using Yondr this year, a system created to keep spaces phone free. The amount of phones principal Andrew Hara saw went from dozens every day to just one phone this year. </P>

		<p class ="redtext" > "A group of students came to me and said they're able to focus better," Hara said. "That was music to my ears."</P>

				<p class ="redtext"> At the beginning of the year,every student’s parents were called to find out if they had a phone. The issue, he said, is that some parents lie so that their child isn’t on the list. Old iPhone models, often with cracked screens, have also found a new purpose as decoy phones, Sosa said. Students put the old one in the pouch, leaving their actual phone free. Administration addressed this by calling home when they see a suspicious phone, asking parents to confirm what the student’s phone actually looks like.</P>

						<p class ="redtext" id= "bluetext">Yonder consists of a small plate-sized, gray magnet and padded, lockable pouches for phones. As students file in, faculty supervises the locking of each pouch. At dismissal, unlocking them is as easy as tapping the bag against the magnet, pulling the needle-like prong free. Schools in New York City began using Yondr in the fall of 2016. </P>
